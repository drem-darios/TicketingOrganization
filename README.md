Design of a ticketing software solutions company

## Problem Statement
Tickets-R-Us is a ticketing software solutions company, whose direct customers (internally referred to as "organizations") host events and sell tickets. Organizations commonly belong to one of these categories - theatre, sports and education. Each event has a title and a URL to its marketing page. An event must have one or more performances. Each performance begins at a specific time and lasts for a pre-defined time period. All performances of a given event may be at the same venue or at multiple venues. But, a given performance must be performed only at a single venue. Also, a performance has a maximum capacity (number of patrons that can attend).

Design the scenario:
- using plain old java objects (POJOs)
- make them immutable whereever it makes sense 
- feel free to use libraries like Guava (optional)
